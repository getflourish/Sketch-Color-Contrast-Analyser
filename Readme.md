# Color Contrast Analyser for Sketch

A Sketch plugin that calculates the color contrast of two layers and evaluates it against the WCAG. If only a single layer is selected, than it will calculate with its artboard background color. The test may pass AAA, AA or fail because of a lack of contrast. And even when you do not need to meet those requirements, you can get a feeling for the contrast when you get used to the values. This might help you design accessible content.

### AA requirements
Color contrast of **4.5:1** or **3.0:1 for large text**

### AAA requirements
Color contrast of **7.0:1** or **4.5:1 for large text**.

### A note on rounding (as of 21 Feb 2020)
The displayed values are not rounded, but limited to display two decimals. For example, a calculated contrast ratio of `1.39999` will be returned as `1.39` and wonâ€™t be rounded to `1.40`. This avoids false positives. 

## A note on "large" text
The WCAG specification of font size is given in CSS points. Those are not equal to the point size in Sketch. Text in Sketch is smaller than its CSS equivalent. Thus, the font size thresholds from the WCAG specification are converted to provide correct results in Sketch.
