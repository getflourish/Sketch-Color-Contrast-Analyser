# Color Contrast Analyser for Sketch

A Sketch plugin that calculates the color contrast of two layers and evaluates it against the WCAG. If only a single layer is selected, than it will calculate with its artboard background color. The test may pass AAA, AA or fail because of a lack of contrast. And even when you do not need to meet those requirements, you can get a feeling for the contrast when you get used to the values. This might help you design accessible content.
